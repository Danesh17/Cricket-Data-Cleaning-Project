# Cricket-Data-Cleaning-Project
- In this project, I have used  Pandas to tidy up cricket data obtained directly from ESPN's website. Cricket, a sport with rich information and diverse match details, often requires careful organizing of data to make sense of it. By automating the data extraction process from ESPN's site and then cleaning the gathered data, aimed to create a well-structured dataset ready for further exploration.

- Data_Analysis_part1.ipynb contains Data Analysis to check whether there is a relationship between the career length and batting average of cricket players. I used a linear regression model to test this relationship statistically.

-The project resulted in a well-organized and cleaned dataset ready for further analysis. By automating the data cleaning process, we streamlined the workflow and reduced manual effort, enabling faster insights generation and decision-making. The cleaned dataset serves as a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and researchers interested in exploring trends, patterns, and performance metrics within the sport.
